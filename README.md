## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
After conducting our linear regression model and summary we can conclude various things about our data. We can determine which variables had what type of effect, how strong is the correlation, and if the model effectively predicts the mpg of the protype vehicles. First the variables that provided an non-random amount of variance are vehicle_length, ground_clearance, and the intercept. In other words the vehicle_length and ground_clearance do effect the mpg of these prototype-vehicles. Based off the p-value = 5.35e-11 we can determine that our slope isn't equal to zero. Our p-value being significantally lower than the value of .05 helps us come to that conclusion. After our results we can conclude that the linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively. We can determine that based off of the results having postive correlation of .72

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils
After conducting our analysis we can see the dataframe for the whole suspension coil csv and we can see the dataframe seperated by lots. When comparing the total_summary with the lot_summary we can see some similarities and many differences. The means and medians are relatively the same, but the variance and sd are no where near eachother. The total variance and each lot variance differ significantly as well as the sd. The total variance(62.29) doesn't exceed our limit of 100. The first and second lot follow in line, but where we see the discrepancy is in lot 3. This lot has a variance over 100 at 170.29, this is the only lot where the current manufacturing data doesn't meet the design specification. The total lot, lot 1, and lot 2 all meet the current manufacturing design specification.
